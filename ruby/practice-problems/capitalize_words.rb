# Write a method that takes in a string of lowercase letters and
# spaces, producing a new string that capitalizes the first letter of
# each word.
#
# You'll want to use the `split` and `join` methods. Also, the String
# method `upcase`, which converts a string to all upper case will be
# helpful.
#
# Difficulty: medium.

# App Academy prep-work:
def capitalize_words(string)

  words = string.split
  words.each { |word| word[0] = word[0].upcase }

  return words.join(" ")
end


# Test cases:
puts(
  'capitalize_words("this is a sentence") == "This Is A Sentence": ' +
  (capitalize_words("this is a sentence") == "This Is A Sentence").to_s
)
puts(
  'capitalize_words("mike bloomfield") == "Mike Bloomfield": ' +
  (capitalize_words("mike bloomfield") == "Mike Bloomfield").to_s
)
