# Catsylvanian money is a strange thing: they have a coin for every
# denomination (including zero!). A wonky change machine in
# Catsylvania takes any coin of value N and returns 3 new coins,
# valued at N/2, N/3 and N/4 (rounding down).
#
# Write a method `wonky_coins(n)` that returns the number of coins you
# are left with if you take all non-zero coins and keep feeding them
# back into the machine until you are left with only zero-value coins.
#
# Difficulty: 3/5

def wonky_coins(n)
  return 1 if n == 0

  # call wonky_coins from inside itself. This is called *recursion*.
  return wonky_coins(n / 2) + wonky_coins(n / 3) + wonky_coins(n / 4)
end


# Test cases:
# it handles a coin of value 1
puts wonky_coins(1)
#=> 3

# it handles a coin of value 5
puts wonky_coins(5)
# 11
# => [2, 1, 1]
# => [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
# => [[[0, 0, 0], 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

# it handles a coin of value 6
puts wonky_coins(6)
#=> 15

# it handles being given the zero coin
puts wonky_coins(0)
#=> 1
