# Ruby

The files under the Ruby/practice-problems directory are of prep-work
exercises provided by App Academy.

The rest of the exercises are from various sources including mock
technical interviews.

There are also notes that I took when learning about Ruby Gotchas:

* [Essentials](essentials.md): Senior programmers won't have a problem
with these, while junior programmers will usually give only half-answers.
* [Good To Know's](good_to_know.md): Separating the professional
from the hobbyist
