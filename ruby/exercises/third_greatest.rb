# Write a method that takes an array of numbers in. Your method should
# return the third greatest number in the array. You may assume that
# the array has at least three numbers in it.
#
# Difficulty: medium.

# App Academy prep-work:
def third_greatest(nums)

  arr = nums.sort

  return arr[-3]
end


# Test cases:
puts(
  'third_greatest([5, 3, 7]) == 3: ' +
  (third_greatest([5, 3, 7]) == 3).to_s
)
puts(
  'third_greatest([5, 3, 7, 4]) == 4: ' +
  (third_greatest([5, 3, 7, 4]) == 4).to_s
)
puts(
  'third_greatest([2, 3, 7, 4]) == 3: ' +
  (third_greatest([2, 3, 7, 4]) == 3).to_s
)
