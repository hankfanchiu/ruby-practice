# What is et cetera?

Most of these files are from random exercises that I've done.
Since they lack a home, I decided to throw them all into one messy repo.

## Ruby

The majority of the files under the Ruby directory are of prep-work exercises
provided by App Academy.

There are also notes that I took when learning about Ruby gotchas:

* [Essentials](/ruby/essentials.md): Senior programmers won't have a problem
with these, while junior programmers will usually give only half-answers.
* [Good To Know's](/ruby/good_to_know.md): Separating the professional
from the hobbyist
