# What is et cetera?

Most of these files are from random exercises that I've done.
Since they lack a home, I decided to throw them all into one messy repo.

## Ruby

The majority of the files under the Ruby directory are of prep-work exercises
provided by App Academy.

There are also notes that I took when learning about Ruby gotchas:

* [Essentials](/ruby/essentials.md)
* [Good To Know's](/ruby/good_to_know.md)
